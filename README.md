### What Will We Do Each Week, and When?

Here is the plan of action for _what you will do and what I will do_ each week for the rest of the semester:

| Step | Who | When                                                 | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|:-----|:----|:-----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Me  | Weekend before a given week                          | Post video content for "lectures" in streamable and downloadable formats. This will include responses to questions asked in the prior week.                                                                                |
| 2    | You | Before watching any video content                    | Review the weekly details and complete the items listed under _Start here this week._                                                                                                                                      |
| 3    | You | After completing the _Start here this week_ material | Download or stream the "lecture" video(s). Have a notepad (physical or digital) open while watching so you can jot down answers to the questions I ask in the video. You should also write down questions you have for me. |
| 4    | Me  | Mid-week or earlier                                  | Post "self-study questions" and a coding exercise video along with any "starter code" that you will need for the exercise.                                                                                                 |
| 5    | You | Before the weekend begins                            | Follow along with the coding exercise video. You should add to your notes and questions during this exercise.                                                                                                              |
| 6    | You | After watching both videos                           | Complete the coding exercise and "self-study questions" for this week. This will include the opportunity to post questions that came up at any point during the week.                                                      |

### Class meetings

**Does this mean I have to do work all week? My class was only on \[insert day\].** The timing and structure described above should make it reasonable to stretch out the work across the time you would normally spend in two class sessions, plus time spent on studying and homework. Or you can wait until I've completed step 4 -- at that point you'll have all the material you need to do the week's work on a single day.

**When will we have class meetings?** There will be no mandatory real-time class meetings.

**If we're not have class meetings, how can we get one-on-one help?** Any one of three ways:

1. During [week 10](week-10.md) you will sign up for a Slack workspace and you can always post a message there.
2. During your regularly-scheduled class times I will be in Slack for real-time chat and audio/visual chat through Webex.
3. From 8am to 9am and 8pm to 9pm Monday through Thursday I will be on Slack for real-time chat and to respond to messages that you may have posted while I was away.

### How will grades be calculated?

Here is the updated grading calculation for the class.

| Assessment                                              | Change (if any)               | Value      |
|:--------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|:-----------|
| Quiz 1: Fundamentals and Functions                      | No change                     | 100 points |
| Quiz 2: Basic Data Structures                           | We will not do this quiz      | 0 points   |
| Quiz 3: Files, Databases, and the Web                   | We will not do this quiz      | 0 points   |
| Quiz 4: OOP Basics                                      | We will not do this quiz      | 0 points   |
| Course Tasks and Worksheets                             | Worth more points (see below) | 450 points |
| Student Evaluations and Reflections                     | No change                     | 50 points  |
| Final Project: Python Module Projects and Presentations | No change                     | 400 points |
| A Totally Optional Final Exam                           | New! (See below)              | 0 points   |

### Other Questions You Might Already Have

**There's a Final Exam now?! Not cool, Professor Allen. Not cool at all.** Here's the deal: Many of you had been preparing to improve on your Quiz 1 grade by doing better on future quizzes, including Quiz 2 which was cancelled before Spring Break. So, I will give a _completely optional_ final exam covering just the topics that we introduce after Spring Break. I will use the average of this exam grade and your quiz 1 grade as a substitute for your quiz 1 grade. E.g., if you earned a 50% on the quiz and a 80% on the final, then your Quiz 1 grade will become (one second, I need to grab my calculator...) a 65%.

**Why are the Course Tasks and Worksheets worth more points?** Instead of taking quizzes in the online version of the course you will do more assignment-type work. This will be mostly coding exercises and "self-study questions" designed to help you do work that will lead to a Python-based data ETL project at the end of the semester.

**Content-wise, what will be different in this version of the class?** The original plan for weeks 10-15 was to get you prepared to do a final project that uses Python to process data from the Web. That is still the goal! The difference is that there will be fewer major new concepts (e.g., UML and custom object- and data-modeling) and I have downsized the project and the remaining topics accordingly.

**Will you be available in real time at all?** Absolutely, yes. You can always post to Slack and I'll respond when I'm available, and there are "office hours" listed above.

**What about all the stuff in Canvas?** I left most of the Canvas material in the state it was in before Spring Break. Mostly I did this to preserve material that you might want to go looking for later.

**Will the final project still be group-work?** Not in the sense that you probably mean it. There will be some amount of student-to-student interaction and coordination, but you'll be completing the project individually.
