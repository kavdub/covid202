Below are answers to some important questions that all students need to review right away.

### What Will We Do Each Week, and When?

Here is the plan for what you will do and what I will do _each week_ for the rest of the semester:

Step | Who | When | What to do
---|---|---|---
1 | Me | Weekend before a given week | Post "self-study questions" and video content for "lectures" in streamable and downloadable formats. This will include responses to questions asked in the prior week.
2 | You | Before watching any video content | Review the weekly details and complete the items listed under _Start here this week._
3  | You  | After completing the _Start here this week_ material | Download or stream the "lecture" video(s). Have a notepad (physical or digital) open while watching so you can jot down answers to the questions I ask in the video. You should also write down questions you have for me.
4  | Me  | Mid-week or earlier |  Post a coding exercise video with "starter code".
5  | You  | Before the weekend begins | Follow along with the coding exercise video. You should add to your notes and questions during this exercise.
6  | You  | After watching both videos | Complete the coding exercise and "self-study questions" for this week. This will include the opportunity to post questions that came up at any point during the week.

### How will grades be calculated?

Here is the updated grading calculation for the class.

Assessment | Change (if any) | Value
---|---|---
Quiz 1: Fundamentals and Functions    | No change                 | 100 points
Quiz 2: Basic Data Structures         | We will not do this quiz  | 0 points
Quiz 3: Files, Databases, and the Web | We will not do this quiz  | 0 points
Quiz 4: OOP Basics                    | We will not do this quiz  | 0 points
Course Tasks and Worksheets           | Worth more points (see below)   | 450 points
Student Evaluations and Reflections   | No change                 | 50 points
Final Project: Python Module Projects and Presentations | No change | 400 points
A Totally Optional Final Exam  | See below | 0 points

### Other Questions You Might Already Have

**There's a Final Exam now?! Not cool, Professor Allen. Not cool at all.** Here's the deal: Many of you (I hope!) had been preparing to improve on your Quiz 1 grade by doing better on future quizzes. So I will give a _completely optional_ final exam covering the topics after Spring Break. I will use the average of this exam grade and your quiz 1 grade as a substitute for your quiz 1 grade. E.g., if you earned a 50% on the quiz and a 80% on the final, then your Quiz 1 grade will become (one second, I need to grab my calculator...) a 65%.

**Why are the Course Tasks and Worksheets worth more points?** Instead of taking quizzes you'll do more assignments of this kind and this is where that work will count towards your grade. Specifically, this will be coding exercises and "self-study questions."

**Content-wise, what will be different in this version of the class?** The original plan for weeks 10-15 was to get you prepared to do a final project that uses Python to process data from the Web. That is still the goal! The difference is that there will be fewer major new concepts (e.g., UML and custom object- and data-modeling) and I have downsized the project and the remaining topics accordingly.

**Does this mean I have to do work all week? My class was only on \[insert day\].** The timing and structure described above should make it reasonable to stretch out the work across two days if you'd like to do that. Or, you can wait until I've posted the mid-week (or earlier) video -- at that point you'll have all the material you need to do the week's work.

**Are there any real-time class meetings?** Nope.

**Will you be available in real time at all?** Absolutely, yes. I'll update this question when I have a sense of what works best for students.

**What about all the stuff in Canvas?** I left most of the Canvas material in the state it was in before Spring Break. Mostly I did this to preserve material that you might want to go looking for later.

**Will the final project still be group-work?** Not in the sense that you probably mean it. There will be some amount of student-to-student interaction and coordination, but you'll be completing the project individually.
