### Other Ideas

There were many other ideas. Here are some that I think are interesting and achievable. If you do not see your idea here (or something similar -- I didn't list similar ideas multiple times) and you want to work on it, post your idea in the `#general` channel in Slack and we'll talk about why it might be problematic.

1. Analyze the character length of trending hashtags in order to see what the optimal character length is to get a hashtag trending.
1. Look at reddit posts and see if there is any correlation between titles, time posted and the number of upvote something gets. Essentially ignoring the content.
