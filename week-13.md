# Week 13: Options for the "Loading" phase of your RTL project.

## What To Do This Week

1. Make progress on writing your code for your final project.
1. Find the three most-similar projects to yours. (Don't worry, you don't have to form a group with them, and you won't be doing peer review for the people you select. It's in order to help me help you by seeing what similarities _you_ see in these projects.)

### Part 1: Continue (or Start) Working on Your Code

Use this time to work on your Data ETL code. You're not all working on the exact same project, so I don't want to over-prescribe what to do. However, at a high level you are all doing these three things:

1. Extracting data (and strategizing about what data to extract.)
1. Transforming data (and strategizing about how to transform your data.)
1. Loading data (see part 2 below.)

Remember, the [instructions for the final are here](https://github.com/warrenallen/covid202/blob/master/final-project.md) and will be updated as we go along.

Also, I post a short video for those of you who might find this beneficial:

### Part 2: The Load Step

There are many ways you might do the "load" step in a Data ETL project. I will post some lecture material about a few Python packages that are very popular for this kind of work.

- [Answering Questions with Data (7 min.)](https://youtu.be/F03W_ppV6MU)
- Text analysis with TextBlob.
  - **Everyone should watch this despite what I said at the end of the first video.** This week's content is already long enough, and maybe we won't require Seaborn for your project after all. So, the following TextBlob videos treat Microsoft Excel as the destination for your "Loading" ETL step instead of another Python module like Seaborn. Excel will be an acceptable alternative to Seaborn for this semesters' projects.

  - [Textblob and Loading data to Excel Part 2 (10 min.)](https://youtu.be/Xz_oh2sCoKo)
  - [Textblob and Loading data to Excel Part 3 (13 min.)](https://youtu.be/idUA01v-wus)

### Do this before the end of the week

- Post your questions to the Slack Q&A channel.
- Work on your final project code.

### Other items and extra resources

- The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) (PyPI).
- The [top PyPi](https://hugovk.github.io/top-pypi-packages/) packages.
- The [textblob](http://textblob.readthedocs.io/) package for processing text data.
- The [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data visualization library based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
