# Week 13: Options for the "Loading" phase of your RTL project.

## What To Do This Week

1. Make progress on writing your code for your final project.
1. Find the three most-similar projects to yours. (Don't worry, you don't have to form a group with them, and you won't be doing peer review for the people you select. It's in order to help me help you by seeing what similarities _you_ see in these projects.)

### Part 1: Continue (or Start) Working on Your Code

Use this time to work on your Data ETL code. You're not all working on the exact same project, so I don't want to over-prescribe what to do. However, at a high level you are all doing these three things:

1. Extracting data (and strategizing about what data to extract.)
1. Transforming data (and strategizing about how to transform your data.)
1. Loading data (see part 2 below.)

Remember, the [instructions for the final are here](https://github.com/warrenallen/covid202/blob/master/final-project.md) and will be updated as we go along.

Also, I post a short video for those of you who might find this beneficial:

### Part 2: The Load Step

There are many ways you might do the "load" step in a Data ETL project. I will post some lecture material about a few Python packages that are very popular for this kind of work.

- The Python package ecosystem.
- Python plotting packages.

### Do this before the end of the week
