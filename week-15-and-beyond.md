# Week 15 and Beyond: Project Summaries, Wrap Up and Final Project

## What To Do This Week (and beyond)

This is it. This is the final countdown! First, some deadlines:

- Your project is due by midnight on May 8. **I will be very strict about this deadline.** You will lose a letter grade for every 12 hours past the posted due date, and at midnight on May 10 the submission window will close and no more work will be accepted.
- Also due May 8 is the final assignment, the **Student Evaluations.** See below for links.

### The (Optional) Final Exam

If you want to take the optional final exam, you must send me a message through Canvas **by midnight on May 1** to tell me you want to take the exam. **Once you tell me you want to take the exam, you may not back out.** If you tell me you want to take the exam and then do not take it, you will earn a zero for the exam and that will be included in the calculation of your final course grade.

- The topics you will need to study are [posted here.](optional-exam.md)
- The exam will be made available through Canvas during a single 60-minute window during finals. I'll work out the specifics once I know who is taking the exam.

### Wrapping up your project

Your projects should be wrapping up soon. TBH I can't believe you still have two weeks to complete it! Lucky you. I'm sure I'll see some great projects.

- If you're stuck, post to the Slack coding-qa channel and/or make an appointment with me to discuss your project: [calendly.com/wrrn](https://calendly.com/wrrn)
- Start writing your project report. You may not be done with your code yet, but that doesn't mean you can't start writing about it. In fact, it may be helpful to start _explaining_ your code if you find yourself stuck or if you're looking for ways to improve your code.
- Finish your code and make sure it works. **Your final project requires functioning code in order to earn a passing grade.**

**So you already have functioning code?**

Once you have finished your code and it is functional (remember, your final project requires functioning code!) maybe you have time to make it even better. Here are some questions to answer for yourself, some of which we covered in class and others we did not.

1. Is your code [PEP-8 compliant](http://pep8online.com)?
2. Is your code [commented well](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#commenting-vs-documenting-code)?
3. Do your functions have [good docstrings](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/#documenting-your-python-code-base-using-docstrings)?
