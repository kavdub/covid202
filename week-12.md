# Week 12: Tweepy, PRAW, and strategizing about your final project

## What To Do This Week

### Part 1: Strategizing about your final project

No video lectures for Part 1 of this week. Instead:

1. Read the (current version of the) [Final Project](final-project.md).
1. Review [my summary of the ideas](project-ideas.md) that you and your classmates proposed in Week 10.
1. Consider what question your final project will use as its basis. If you have questions about what you might work on or if you want to explore about your project, post them to the `#general` channel in Slack instead of emailing or DM-ing me.

It won't be "set in stone" but you will be expected to have your project idea decided to a certain degree of confidence by the end of this week. Trust me when I say it's best to spread this work out over the next few weeks; not because it's a lot of work (although it will be if you leave it all to Finals Week) but because there are many opportunities to run into unanticipated problems for which you need to seek assistance.
