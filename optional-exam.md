## Final (optional) exam

These are the topics that will be covered in the optional exam.

- The Data ETL process: What is it, what are its steps, and can you match a given code example to the specific step in the process.
- APIs: What are they, and what role to they play in the Data ETL process?
- Storing data in CSV- and JSON-formatted text files. What is the difference, and can you fix/complete example scripts.
- Twitter and Reddit APIs: How do you set up your code to use them, and can you fix/complete example scripts that use them. (I'll let you choose either Twitter-based or Reddit-based questions for this section)

If you want to take the optional final exam, you must send me a message through Canvas **by midnight on May 1** to tell me you want to take the exam. **Once you tell me you want to take the exam, you may not back out.** If you tell me you want to take the exam and then do not take it, you will earn a zero for the exam and that will be included in the calculation of your final course grade.
