## Interested in looking at more COVID-19 Tweets than you can collect?

I've been collecting Tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic since late January.
I am making available to you a sample of that database for your project. You'll
use this instead of the Twitter API, but the rest (transforming and loading
the Tweets) is the same as if you got the Tweets from directly from Twitter.

You'll need some starter code and a little bit of instruction:

- [Video: How to access Dr. Allen's COVID-19 Tweets DB](https://youtu.be/ZgXeWvh6Nio)
- [Starter code](code-for-students/coviddb.py) (password for DB is in the video)
- [One example Tweet](code-for-students/example-tweet.txt)
- [One example Retweet](code-for-students/example-tweet.txt)
