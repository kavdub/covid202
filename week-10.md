## Week 10: Getting (Re-)Started and Working with Data API

### What To Do This Week

#### Before you watch the first weekly video:

**Read closely the [README page](README.md) page.** It describes some important details about how we will complete this class. Bookmark the page so you have quick and easy access to it.

**Join the 202 Support Slack Workspace using the link below.** Some quick items about how we will use Slack:

- Official class announcements will be posted to Slack and will also be sent via email.
- Office hours (for class and for meeting with me as Program Director) will be hosted in Slack, but there will also be a video conferencing platform for times where you want to chat with audio/video capabilities.
- The space is set up with three default channels:
- The `coding-qa` channel is for coding-related Questions and Answers. This can be class-related, but it doesn't strictly have to be.
- The `#random` channel is for random (but [SFW!](https://www.acronymfinder.com/Safe-for-Work-(website-links)-(SFW).html)) stuff you just feel like sharing.
- The `#general` channel is for stuff that is neither coding-related nor random.

#### Part 1: Lecture and Q&A

To give us some time to get settled in to this new environment I'll just post a couple of short coding videos, below.

#### Part 2: Coding and Q&A

- Reddit (review)
- Setting up Python to access the Twitter API

#### Do this before the end of the week

- Create a Twitter account to use for class. You _can use an existing account_ if you want to -- you won't have to post anything to Twitter unless you decide on doing a project that posts things to Twitter (e.g., creating a Twitter bot.)
- Complete the weekly self-assessment questions.
- Post your questions to the Slack Q&A channel.
- Prepare for next week.

#### Other items and extra resources

Twitter Resources

- [The Twitter API documentation hub.](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) There is more here that you'll ever need! But it's the root of all Twitter API documentation so it's at least good to know where it is.
- Using the [advanced search](https://twitter.com/search-advanced) on Twitter can be a useful place to start when you're thinking about what to search for on Twitter. This is the documentation for doing the same kind of search using the API: [Standard search API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/overview)
- Here is the very, very useful documentation for [what is in Twitter JSON data.](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json)
