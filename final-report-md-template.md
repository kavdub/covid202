## Title of Your Project

Summarize your project; e.g., what question are you asking? What technologies are you using? Write this _paragraph_ for a public audience, not for me or your classmates.

## Code Walkthrough

Describe the first block of code. Include a bulleted list of the packages you are using, with a short description of what role they play in your code. Your import statements _might_ be the only this in this block of code.

- Package name. Description goes here.
- Package name. Description goes here.

Describe the next block of code, and continue until all of your blocks of code are inserted and explained. The purpose is to clearly describe what each block of code does. It doesn't have to be line-by-line; in fact, it should not be and you wouldn't want to write that much!

## Summary of Results

Summarize the tool you used (Excel?) after your loading process and what the goal is (a chart? what kind?). Also summarize your results, including at least one visual element (e.g., a chart of your data).

## What I Would do Next

Your code must run without errors, and it must produce data that responds to/moves your question forward (as you'll surely recall from recent video lectures.) However, there is always more work to do! If you were doing this project for realsies, what would come next? How would you improve this code in order to provide better data and a better answer?
