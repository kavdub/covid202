# Week 11: Databases and Storing (a little bit of) data with PickleDB

## What To Do This Week

This week we'll work with Reddit data, although the basic processes and the type of code we are writing will also work with the Twitter API.

### Part 1

Part 1 is more data ETL, with some examples of how to do the "T" part with Reddit data. If you need to, review what each of the following are before watching these videos:

- Python lists.
- Python dictionaries.
- Iterating with for loops.

You'll want to have your Python environment (ideally [repl.it](http://repl.it)) ready to follow along. Make use of the pause function to code as you go.

Video lectures:

- Transforming Reddit data:

  - [Part B](https://youtu.be/KvQfW7yVOGk)
  - [Part C](https://youtu.be/OHqfcgqIl10)

### Part 2

Part 2 focuses on storing raw and transformed data in a local database. Do this before watching the videos:

- Read what [the PickleDB library](https://patx.github.io/pickledb/) is and does.
- Bookmark [this very minimal documentation](https://patx.github.io/pickledb/commands.html) for reference later on.

Video lectures:

- Loading raw and processed data into a database.

### Do this before the end of the week

- Post your questions to the Slack Q&A channel.
- Complete the weekly self-assessment, posted in Canvas:

  - [Section 4](https://rutgers.instructure.com/courses/40200/assignments/700987)

### Other items and extra resources

- PickleDB is not a "serious" database, but it works well for our purposes. If you're curious what a serious alternative is, check out [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
