## Other Ideas?

I don't want to scare you off of the idea of using data that interests you, but keep this in mind:

> _I can only provide _very limited help_ with data sources that I don't already know. This includes troubleshooting (does the NASA API work? I've never used it, so I don't know) and answering questions about how to get data or what the data means (what even is a Pokeman? I have no freaking clue.) There will be no extensions or exceptions given for this project, so as soon as possible make sure you know that a dataset works the way you think it works._

There are many, many data sources out there that you could use for this project. Here are just a few:

- [The Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- [The last.fm music data API](https://www.last.fm/api)
